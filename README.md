Lamia Weather Station Graphs page. This is the standalone script version for creating the weather graphs on our page. Make sure
you read the wiki page on how to properly configure them.

<strong> <a href="http://www.euacosmos.com/weather/">Live demo</a> </strong>  

Before start using the script, read the <a href="https://github.com/Virtuosofriend/weathergraphs/wiki/"> Wiki page</a>.  

- Version 1.5  
Completely changed the details box at the bottom of the graphs. You now can show real statistical analysis depending on your recordings, without use any custom Weather Display testtags.
Code cleaned up and removed the extra jQuery loading screen.  
Solar graph is optimized to load faster (removed all the zero values from night time recordings).  
Proper Greek translation including months and tooltips.
Bug fixes.

- Version 1.4  
Details box added below the graphs. It shows max and min values of the chart. It can be globally disabled, read the wiki page for details.  
Solar graph is properly plotted now.  
Small bug fixes, like page title properly changes on new chart plot.  

- Version 1.3

Solar graph is added. Make sure you read the wiki page for properly using it.  
UTC timestamp removed. Time is taken from your csv files now.

- Version 1.2

All graphs are combined on the same page. No need to refresh that page in order to plot the new graph.
Unified configuration file for all graphs.
Greek language translation added
